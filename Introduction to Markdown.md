To make a list we use the following: 

* this is the first item in the list 
* this is the second 
    * this is actually a subpoint in this list 

- this is also a list 
- you can use these bullets asa well  
    - you can also use subpoints with dashes 

1. this is the first item in an ordered list 
2. this is the second 
    1. this is s sublist 
    2. this is another 
        - this is unorder 
        - same here
